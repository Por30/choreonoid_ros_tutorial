# choreonoid_ros_tutorial

## Project Overview
This project is a course assignment that implements a control system for a tank robot using Choreonoid and ROS. It enables basic motion control of the tank robot in a simulated environment.

## Features
- ROS node for controlling the tank robot remotely
- Integration with the Choreonoid simulation platform to simulate robot movements
- Supports basic motion commands such as forward, backward, and turning

## Technologies Used
- ROS (Robot Operating System)
- Choreonoid simulation software
- C++ / Python 

## Installation
1. Install ROS
2. Install Choreonoid simulation software
